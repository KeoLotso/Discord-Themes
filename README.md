## 🎨 Themes

### Blurcord
Blurs **everything** in Discord.

### Australien Discord
Everything is upside down.

### Sharpcord
(almost) Everything is sharp and no more animations for you. Say goodbye to rounded corners and your smooth animations.

### Grannys UI
Everything is **Bold** and big.

### Flashbang 
Flashbangs just get thrown at you, you cant defend and you just have to enjoy your white screen for a second.
